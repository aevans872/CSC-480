# CSC-480: Data Mining
# Final Project - Political Party Prediction with the General Social Survey and Machine Learning Classification
This is the final project I submitted for my data mining course in which I used several machine learning models to predict political party affiliation.
You can navigate to the 'code.ipynb' file to view all code used in the project and navigate to 'research paper.pdf' to view my complete research project paper submitted. The 'gss2021.csv' dataset was used in this project and is attached as well.
